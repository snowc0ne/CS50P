# Implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein: x is an integer y is one of +, -, *, or / and z is an integer

    z = int(expression[2]) #Converts the third element of the array to an integer
