# In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case. For example, if the user inputs numberOfCollegeGraduates, the output should be number_of_college_graduates. You may assume that the input will contain only letters and no spaces.

def main():
    # Prompt the user for the name of a variable in camel case
    camel_case = input("Enter a variable in camelCase: ")

    # Initialize an empty string to store the snake case version of the variable
    snake_case = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the camel case variable
    for char in camel_case:
        # If the character is uppercase, add an underscore followed by the lowercase version of the character
        if char.isupper():
            snake_case += "_" + char.lower()
        # Otherwise, add the character as is
        else:
            snake_case += char

    # Print the snake case version of the variable
    print(f"snake_case: {snake_case}")
